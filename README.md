  ### Bringing Linux to your Pterodactyl-hosted servers.</div>

&nbsp;

# What is Harbor
Harbor is a script that downloads, configures and runs [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) minirootfs on your Pterodactyl-hosted servers with root privileges and with as little of a footprint as possible creating essentially a type of "virtual machine" out of your server. The goal is to provide a tool that will run on as many hosting services using Pterodactyl as possible using various loaders for the script written in various different languages such as Java, GoLang, Python, etc.

&nbsp;

# Roadmap
- [ ] Full `AARCH64` support.
- [ ] Automatically fetch latest Alpine version. (probably yes)
- [ ] Automatic script updater. (no)
- [ ] Create some basic wrappers for the script. (idk)
- [x] Aim ubuntu 22.04

# Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Any hosting provider that utilizes [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io).
* The hosting provider must allow running unverified applications.

### Minimum System Requirements
The server must have all of the following system requirements to run:
* `x86_64` or `AARCH64` CPU*
* 40 Megabytes Available Disk Space*
* 35 Megabytes Available RAM
* Internet Connectivity

*- You can try running it, it will tell you if your CPU is not supported. <br />
*- You can probably get away with a tiny little less disk space.

### Help
